# Back in the game like Jack Lalanne

That heading is a lyric in the song [_Meat Grinder_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Ru8d0l_fU) by [**Madvillain**](http://stonesthrow.com/madvillain) and also how I am viewing my return to motion graphics during this hot September in the year of our lord, 2023.

It has been a minute since I made anything of substance. And I think these are the first graphicy things I'm committing to GitHub. These README files are being written in markdown language in VS Code. I mention that because there may be some spelling errors that VS Code is unable to help me with and I've become accostomed to beginning any project, whatever the medium, by typing out a README.md file in VS Code.

Did I mention that I took a sidebar for a couple of years to get some mental health help and to learn some coding. If you traipse through the repos here, you may find some of the work I did. Most of the work is slapdash and bumbling, mostly attempts by me to complete things. And while I appreciate the world of front end web design's big three (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and Python, I arrived at the determination that I am more suited in focusing my energies on motion graphics.

So I am back in the game. Much like Jack Lalanne. RIPower MF Doom. Please enjoy what I bring forth from my computer by clicking through the repos here. Fork and create from the things I commit. I'll share as much as the storage limits allow. If you have questions, please consult other README.md files or reach out.

Be good to yourself. You are all you have. Control what you can. Let other things go. Trust your brain.

All done. Please enjoy.
